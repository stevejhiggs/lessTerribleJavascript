# lessTerribleJavascript
supporting files for my "How I became a less terrible javascript developer" talk

sets up a simple environment supporting the following:

* client side modules using webpack
* es6 support using babel
* sass support and transformation
* linting using eslint

It's built up gradually so feel free to look back through the commits to see each feature being added
